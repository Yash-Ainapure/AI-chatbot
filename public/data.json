INDUSTRY-INSTITUTE INTERACTION IS A MAJOR FACTOR TO ENABLE THE INDIAN EDUCATION SECTOR SCALE UP IN THE GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE INDEX. With the advent of globalization and opening up of Indian economy to outside world, competition among industries has become stiff. To solve their engineering problems, they look up now to engineering institutions. Similarly, there is an urgent need to prepare engineering students for jobs in multinational companies, by exposing them to newer technologies and engineering methodologies. These objectives can only be achieved well by bridging the gap between industry and the academic institutions. Better interaction between technical institutions and industry is the need of the hour. This will have great bearing on the engineering curriculum, exposure of engineering students to industrial atmosphere and subsequent placement of young graduating engineers in industries across the country. Industries and institutes have been collaborating for over a century, but the rise of a global knowledge economy has intensified the need for strategic partnerships. The Institutes are imparting the basic knowledge and skill, but the Industry-Institute Interaction will enable to undertake research by staff and students relevant to the industry. The Industry-Institute Interaction should be designed to run longer period for preparing the manpower of world class in the field of science and technology by inculcating the various skills required by the industry, thereby contributing to the economic and social development at large.
